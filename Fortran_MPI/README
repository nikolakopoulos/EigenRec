------
About:
------

This software implements a distributed Lanczos method where 
the coefficient matrix is formed as A = V' * V -- the matrix
A is never formed explicitly.


--------
Release:
--------

Release 1.1


---------------
Included files:
---------------

1) additional_subroutines.f90

2) mpi_sparse_lanczos_routines.f90

3) driver_EIGENREC.f90


-------------
Dependencies:
-------------

The user must have the BLAS and LAPACK libraries
installed in his/her machine. An MPI library should
also be installed -- this is a parallel software.
To perform the sparse Matrix-Vector products we
use the Intel MKL library. The user can modify this
part to allow for the MV routine of his/her choice.

In addition, the user should supply a routine which
reads matrix V' and loads it into the system. Then,
the code will automatically distribute the input
matrix to the different processors. To read the input
matrix and extract the CSR format, this software uses 
the SPARSKIT library. It is freely available at:

http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/software/SPARSKIT/

The mmio.f file to read the matrix is provided in
the present release.
